Hi, Iâ€™m **Sadanand Singh**. I work at [Whiterabbit.ai.](https://whiterabbit.ai/) I build AI models in medical imaging and enjoy working with Algorithms, Python/C++, and medical and biological data. My background is in computational physics, numerical modeling and optimization and software design. I have a PhD in computational physics/chemical engineering focusing on computational models of nano-materials and bio-molecules.

My active area of research is in applications of deep learning and computer vision in medical imaging and in the radiology business. I am specifically interested in designing AI models that are explainable and tractable.

## Research Interests

-   Applications of deep learning algorithms to multi-modal screening mammography for classification and localization of cancer
-   Development of explainable AI models for medical applications.
-   Domain adaptation of Deep Leaning and Machine Learning models
-   Self-supervised learning to incorporate large amounts of unlabeled medical data
-   Applications of modern web technologies to make deep learning research more transparent, reproducible and easy to share.
-   Using fundamentals of stochastic learning to model consumer behavior.
